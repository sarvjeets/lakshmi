class _Solver:
    """Internal class to help allocate cash to portfolio (helper class for the
    next class).

    I tried using scipy optimize instead of this custom solver and it was
    extremely flaky for this purpose (even after scaling/conditioning the
    inputs well). So finally, I came up theis heuristic algo which I 'feel'
    works, but I haven't proved it formally.  This class can be further
    optimized/fixed, but for now it serves its purpose.  -- sarvjeets

    Notation:
    - f_i: Money in asset i orginally.
    - x_i: New money to be added to asset i (what we are solving for).
    - A_j: Money in asset class j.
    - C_j: Money in asset class j before adding new money (implementd as
    self.money)
    - d_j: Desired ratio of asset class j (implemented as self.desired_ratio).
    - a_{ij}: Ratio of asset i in asset class j (implemented as
    self.allocation).

    So,
    A_j = \\sum_i a_{ij} (f_i + x_i)
    \\sum_j A_j = T (a constant, given by self.total)

    Error E = \\sum_j (A_j/(d_j T) - 1)^2

    Derivative wrt a asset i (implemented as self.derivative)
    dE/dx_i = (2/T) \\sum_j (a_{ij} / d_j) (A_j/(d_j T) - 1)
    Rate of change of above derivative wrt asset k:
    d^2E/{dx_i dx_k} = (2/T^2) \\sum_j (a_{ij} a_{kj} / d^2_j)

    The algorithm (very loose description here, if this works, I'll probably
    write it more formally):
    0. Without lost of generality, assume cash to be allocated is positive (
    the other way round just replaces min with max in the following algo). We
    also dedup same assets so that the equations in Step 2 has a unique
    solution.
    1. Start by the lowest derivative asset.
    2. Add money to asset to match the derivative of a target asset. Pick the
    next target asset based on whichever target asset leads to lowest
    derivative.
    3. Now we have two assets with same derivatives, keep repeating step 2
    until all assets have same derivatives.
    4. If we run out of cash to allocate before all assets have same
    derivative, exit early.
    5. If we still have money after all assets have same derivative, add extra
    money to all assets while keeping their derivatives the same.

    There is special case where we run out of money in an asset. In that case,
    we just zero out the asset, take it from the list of assets that are
    being optimized and go back to step 2.

    For step 2, we solve the following linear equations:
    k is summing over assets with same derivatives. n is target asset to which
    we are not adding money (aka x_n = 0).

    For each i:
    dE/dx_i + \\sum_{k != i} x_k d^2E/{dx_i dx_k} =
                 dE/dx_n + \\sum_k x_k d^2E/{dx_i dx_k}
    (This equation is solved in self.compute_delta).

    self.allocate_all_cash solves:
    dE/dx_i + \\sum_{k != i} x_k d^2E/{dx_i dx_k} =
                 dE/dx_i (without any additional money allocated to it) + 0.1
    which simplifies to:
    for each i:
    \\sum_k (x_k \\sum_j a{ij} a_{kj} / d^2_j = 0.1T
