## Introduction
This document goes through some suggestions, tips and tricks for
using the `lak` tool. For detailed help on the `lak` tool, please
see the [lak user guide](./lak.md).

## Clean-up config files
By default, the lak config files are in the user home directory.
This clutters up the home directory, and many users would prefer to move these
files elsewhere. `lak` supports overriding these defaults. For linux-based
systems, it is recommended that the config files are moved to `~/.config/lak`
directory and the cache is moved to `~/.cache/lakshmicache`.

First move the config files and cache (if some of these
files don't exist, you can safely ignore them):

```shell
mkdir -p ~/.config/lak
mkdir -p ~/.cache
# Move all the config files to .config/lak
mv ~/portfolio.yaml ~/.performance.yaml ~/.lakrc ~/.config/lak
# Move cache to .cache
mv ~/.lakshmicache ~/.cache/lakshmicache
```

Now modify `lakrc` to point to new configuration directories. Edit
`~/.config/lak/.lakrc` and replace the existing paths with the new locations:

```
portfolio: '~/.config/lak/portfolio.yaml'
performance: ~/.config/lak/.performance.yaml
cache: '~/.cache/lakshmicache'
```

Finally, make sure `lak` is reading its config from the new file. In your
shell configuration file (e.g. `.bashrc` for Bash or `.zshrc` for Zsh),
add the following line:

```shell
export LAK_CONFIG=~/.config/lak/.lakrc
```

## Turn on auto-completion

`lak` is built on top of `click` which supports
[shell completion](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.0.x/shell-completion)
for Bash, Zsh and Fish shells. Shell completion is very useful and suggests
commands, option names for commands, etc.

Completion can be enabled by invoking `lak` during start-up for every shell
session, but this is slow. The recommended method is to generate a config
file once and source that into shell of your choice.

For Bash:

```shell
_LAK_COMPLETE=bash_source lak > ~/.config/.lak-complete.bash

# Source the file in ~/.bashrc.
. ~/.config/lak-complete.bash
```

For Zsh:

```shell
_LAK_COMPLETE=zsh_souce lak > ~/.config/.lak-complete.zsh

# Source the file in ~/.zshrc.
. ~/.config/lak-complete.zsh
```

For Fish:

```shell
# Save the script to ~/.config/fish/completions/lak.fish:
_LAK_COMPLETE=fish_source lak > ~/.config/fish/completions/lak.fish
```

## Manage multiple portfolios

Many times users will find themselves managing multiple independent portfolios.
The recommended way for doing this is to create multiple `lak` config files,
each pointing to a difference portfolio file (and optionally a perfomance
file if checkpointing is used). For example:

```
# ~/.config/lak/lakrc1
portfolio: '~/.config/lak/portfolio1.yaml'
performance: ~/.config/lak/.performance1.yaml
cache: '~/.cache/lakshmicache' # This can be shared.
```

```
# ~/.config/lak/lakrc2
portfolio: '~/.config/lak/portfolio2.yaml'
performance: ~/.config/lak/.performance2.yaml
cache: '~/.cache/lakshmicache' # This can be shared.
```

```
# ~/.config/lak/lakrc3
portfolio: '~/.config/lak/portfolio3.yaml'
performance: ~/.config/lak/.performance3.yaml
cache: '~/.cache/lakshmicache' # This can be shared.
```

Then you can create aliases in your shell config file (`.bashrc` for bash or
`.zshrc` for Zsh):

```shell
alias lak1='LAK_CONFIG=~/.config/lak/.lakrc1 lak'
alias lak2='LAK_CONFIG=~/.config/lak/.lakrc2 lak'
alias lak3='LAK_CONFIG=~/.config/lak/.lakrc3 lak'
```

After this, `lak1` command can be used to manage portfolio 1 and so on.

## Setting up automatic emails

One of the benefits of using `lak` is that users can automate a lot of
portfolio monitoring tasks. Instead of accessing your portfolio through
the `lak` tool manually, users can create a script to send them emails
periodically. For example, below is a shell script to send an HTML email
about the portfolio status:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

EMAIL=YOUR_EMAIL_HERE@DOMAIN.com
PATH=PATH_TO_LAK_TOOL:$PATH

# This depends on the ssmtp tool. You can replace this with your installed
# email program.
cat << EMAIL_END | ssmtp $EMAIL
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
To:${EMAIL}
Subject: Portfolio Update

<html>
<head>
  <style>
    table, th, td {
      border: 2px solid black;
      border-collapse: collapse;
      padding: 6px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>

<h2>tl;dr</h2>
<pre>
$(lak analyze tlh -p 10 -d 20000 rebalance)
</pre>

<br><hr><br>

<h2>Asset Allocation</h2>
$(lak list -f html aa -c 'US,Intl,Bonds')

<br>

$(lak list -f html total)

<br><hr><br>

<h2>Assets</h2>
$(lak list -f html assets)

<br><hr><br>

<h2>Tax lots</h2>
$(lak list -f html lots)

<h2>Performance</h2>
$(lak list -f html performance)

</body>
</html>
EMAIL_END
```

A scheduling program like [cron](ttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/cron) can be
used to run this script periodically. For example, to send this email monthly
on the 5th day at 5am:
```
# Entry for lak in crontab:
00 05 5 * * portfolio_email.sh
```
## How to reorder list of accounts or assets
There is currently no automated way to re-order list of accounts or assets
appearing in `lak list accounts` or `lak list assets`. But the
[portfolio file](./lak.md#portfolio) can be manually edited and different
sections can be moved around to achieve this. Please see
[Portfolio file syntax](./lak.md#portfolio-file-syntax) for help on the syntax
of this file.
